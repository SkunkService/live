    <h2>2. No Spamming or Self-Promotion</h2>
    <p>Please refrain from posting spam, advertisements, or excessive self-promotion. If you want to share something, ensure it is relevant and adds value to the conversation.</p>

    <h2>3. Keep Content Appropriate</h2>
    <p>All content shared within the community should be suitable for all ages. Inappropriate content, including graphic violence, adult material, or offensive language, is prohibited.</p>

    <h2>4. Stay On-Topic</h2>
